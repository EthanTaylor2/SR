# Deep Reasonging with Knowledge Graph for Social Relationship Understanding

This repo includes the source code of the paper: "Deep Reasonging with Knowledge Graph for Social Relationship Understanding" (IJCAI 2018) by Zhouxia Wang, Tianshui Chen, Jimmy Ren, Weihao Yu, Hui Cheng, Liang Lin.

## Environment

The code is tested on 64 bit Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS), and besed on Pytorch with Python 2.7.

## Dataset
[PISC](https://zenodo.org/record/1059155#.WznPu_F97CI) was release by J. Li et al. in ICCV 2017. It involves two-level relationship, coarse-level relationship(alias domain) which has 3 categories and fine-level relationship which has 6 categories. More detail can be found in the [link](https://zenodo.org/record/1059155#.WznPu_F97CI) or in our paper.

[PIPA-relation](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-multimodal-computing/research/human-activity-recognition/social-relation-recognition/) was release by Q. Sun et al. in CVPR 2017. It alse involves two-level relationship, 5 social domains and 16 social relations. In our experiment, we only focus on the 16 social relations.
